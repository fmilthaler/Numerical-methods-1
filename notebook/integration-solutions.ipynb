    "Knowing the value of the area under a curve is important to all kinds of applications. However, many expressions are difficult to integrate analytically, or the function which governs their shape is unknown, and we only have data. Therefore, no course on numerical methods is complete without discussing the different methods of numerical integration. \n",

    "\n",
    "As with previous lectures, the choice of approximation method, as well as the size of the intervals, will control the error.  Better methods as well as smaller (i.e. more to cover our total interval of interest: $[a,b]$) sub-intervals will lead to lower errors, but will cost more.\n",

    "\n",
    "The midpoint rule, $M$, approximates the integral over this sub-interval by the area of a rectangle, with base of length $h$ and  height of the value of $f(x)$ at the midpoint of that interval (i.e. at $x=(a+b)/2$):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "M = hf \\left ( \\frac {a+b} {2} \\right )\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that is what follows we assume that we have been given the function $f(\\cdot)$ such that we can evaluate it anywhere. However, this comes at a cost and so in our quadrature methods we want good accuracy without excessive numbers of function evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the integration over the entire interval of interest, is then just the sum of the integrals over all the sub-intervals, i.e. the sum of the areas of all the small rectanges. \n",
    "\n",
    "A complex example looks like this, where the red line shows the original function we wish to compute the integral of, and the blue rectangles *approximate* the area under that function for a number of sub-intervals:\n",

    "Clearly the sum of the areas of all the rectanges provides an estimate of the true integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Note that the SciPy module features many different integration functions, and you can find thorough documentation for these functions (including methods not covered in this course) [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html). This library does not contain a function for the midpoint rule but it is trivial to create our own.]"

    "Perhaps most surprisingly, the midpoint rule is more accurate than the trapezoid rule - this is not obvious from the discussions and the images above.\n",

    "If a quadrature rule of order $p$ is used to integrate a smooth function over an interval of size $h$, then Taylor series analysis shows the error is proportional to $h^p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the midpoint and trapezoid rules are exact for constant and linear functions, but are not exact for quadratics. Therefore, they have order two (as we saw above in terms of how their errors reduced with smaller $h$). \n",

While the mid-point rule will have parts of each rectangle above and below the curve, hence to a certain extent the errors will cancel each other out. This is why for this example the errors in the mid-point rule turn out to be approximately half those in the trapezoidal rule.  While this turns out to be *generally* true for smooth functions, we can always come up with (counter) examples where the trapezoid rule will win (can you think of an example?).\n",
