    "The conditioning (or lack of, i.e. the ill-conditioning) of matrices we are trying to invert (to obtain the inverse, or to find the solution to a linear matrix system) is incredibly important for the success of any algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we started talking about matrices we noted that as long as the matrix is non-singular, i.e. $\\det(A)\\ne 0$ then an inverse exists, and a linear system with that $A$ has a unique solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens when we consider a matrix that is nearly singluar, i.e. $\\det(A)$ is very small?\n",

    "\n",
    "Two types/families of methods exist to solve matrix systems.  These are termed *direct* methods and *iterative* (or *indirect*) methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct methods perform operations on the linear equations (the matrix system), e.g. the substitution of one equation into another which we performed two weeks ago for your example $2\\times 2$ system considered in MM1. This (and the subsequent Gaussian elimination algorithm) transformed the equations making up the linear system into equivalent ones with the aim of eliminating unknowns from some of the equations and hence allowing for easy solution through back (or forward) substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in MM1 you learnt Cramer's rule which gives an explicit formula for the inverse of a matrix, or for the solution of a linear matrix system.  It was pointed out that the computational cost (in terms of arithmetic operations required; also termed complexity) scaled like $(n+1)!$, whereas the Gaussian elimination (which is basically the susbtitution method done above) scaled like $n^3$.  For large $n$ Gaussian elimination will clearly be more efficient - you considered the case where $n=100$ in MM1 for example. $n$ here refers to the number of unknowns or equations, or sometimes termed the *degrees of freedom* of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of direct methods is that they provide the exact solution (assuming exact arithmetic, i.e. ignoring the round off related issues mentioned above) in a finite number of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as pointed out previously, $n$ could be billions for hard-core applications such as in weather forecasting. In this case the $n^3$ operations required of a direct algorithm such as Gaussian elimination is also prohibitive. In attempt to further reduce this cost *iterative* algorithms were devised.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms start with an initial guess at the solution ($\\pmb{x}_0$), and *iteratively* improve this producing a series of approximate answers $\\pmb{x}_k$. For the *exact* answer to the matrix system $A\\pmb{x} = \\pmb{b}$, we know that the residual vector $\\pmb{r} = A\\pmb{x}-\\pmb{b}$ is zero. For our iterative procudure, we can use the norm of the residual vector $\\pmb{r}_k = A\\pmb{x}_k-\\pmb{b}$ based on the approximate solution $\\pmb{x}_k$, as a measure of how close we are to solving the equation (the norm $\\|\\pmb{r}_k\\|$ expresses this as a single number). As we iterate futher, we hope to drive down this number and we may stop the iteration at some small (non-zero) residual norm tolerance level. The final iteration gives us an answer $\\pmb{x}_k$ which is still an approximation to the solution and not the exact solution we would obtain with direct methods.  The residual norm tolerance stopping criteria therefore needs to be thought about carefully, e.g. depending on how accurate a solution $\\pmb{x}$ we require.\n",

    "Note that the matrices which result from the numerical solution of differential equations are generally  *sparse* (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix>) which means that most entries are zero (the alternative is termed *dense*).  Knowing which entries are zero means that we can devise more efficient matrix storage methods, as well as more efficient implementations of the above algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, for the two iterative methods shown above (Jacobi and Gauss Seidel), the cost of each iteration is quadratically dependent on the number of unknowns $n$, since we need to loop through all the entries of the $n\\times n$ matrix $A$. For a fixed number of iterations the computational cost of these methods therefore scales as $n^2$. If we know that each row only contains a fixed, small number of non-zero entries however (as for example the matrix in the last exercise), we can simply skip the zero entries and the cost *per iteration* becomes linear in $n$. These scalings of $n^2$ for *dense* and $n$ for *sparse* matrices for the cost per iteration are typical for iterative methods. Unfortunately this does not mean that the overal cost of an iterative method is also $n^2$ or $n$, as the number of iterations that is needed to achieve a certain accuracy quite often also increases for bigger problem sizes. The number of required iterations typically only increases very slowly however, so that the cost of the method is still considerably cheaper than direct methods, in particular for very large problems.\n",
